An android app built in Java which emulates notification LED on modern devices. Built this app as I liked the idea of notification LED but phone manufacturers were removing this to pursue bigger screens. It kinda blew up and has more than 5M+ downloads and 200K+ weekly users. Got featured on [XDA](https://www.xda-developers.com/notifybuddy-amoled-notification-led/), [Android Authority](https://www.androidauthority.com/notify-buddy-1006475/) and [Mrwhosetheboss](https://youtu.be/dSKALhlsuE8?list=PLflqtq8EOGAKxyigzU6wdbDWyi_3v2mIi&t=307).
